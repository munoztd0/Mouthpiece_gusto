The repository contains all scripts needed to reproduce the results reported in the above study.


# Code

The code is split in three main folders

*  ./mouth_piece -3D printing files (stl) including seven versions with a diameter of 2.5 mm Â± 0.3 mm in steps of 0.1 mm. 
 
*  ./preprocessing -costum build pipeline for preprocessing the anatomical and functional data (FSL 3.3.0 and ANTs 2.1.0 or higher)
 
* ./univariate - scripts for the massive univariate analysis (Matlab R2017 or higher, with SPM 12 and AFNI 20.3)
 
* ./behavioral - scripts for the behavioral analysis  (R 3.6.0 or higher)
